# Sentiment Analysis 🎭

Within this exercise we'll make use of a few NLP tecniques like removing stopwords, Stemming, Lemmatizing or Frequency counting. Afterwards we'll use Sentiment-Intensity-Analizer to see how sentences are classified (Positive, Negative and Neutral)   


## 📣Foreword

 Since the aim of this exercise is to get sentiment from text, and specially reviews, I thought opportune to pay homage to the oldest known customer review of the story, wich is the Ea-Nasir clay table dated from 1750 B.C. In wich basically a really angry merchant called Nanni wrote down all his customer frustration aimed to a copper merchant named Ea-Nasir.
